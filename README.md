We just got hired by a tunnel boring company which uses X-rays in an attempt to know rock density, ideally this will allow them to switch out boring heads on their equipment before having to mine through the rock! They have given us some lab test results of signal strength returned in nHz to their sensors for various rock density types tested. You will notice it has almost a sine wave like relationship, where signal strength oscillates based off the density, the researchers are unsure why this is, and we have to find this
